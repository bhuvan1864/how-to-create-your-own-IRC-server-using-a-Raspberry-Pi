There are two main benefits to creating your own server:

1. Complete control over the chat experience
With your own IRC server, you’ll have the freedom to assign your own moderators, create channels for the topics you care about, and have the final say in who can and can’t join your server – perfect if you’re sick of your online discussions getting hijacked by trolls, bots, spammers and other digital undesirables.

2. Take control of your data
Are you concerned about a third party leaking your information accidentally, selling it on purpose, or using it in targeted adverts?

By running your own server, you can maintain control over all your data, ranging from your username and email address, right through to your IRC chat logs.
